            <p>
              A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
              Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
              experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
              diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
              content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
              strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes
              daily for five days a week.

            <h1>Limitations of BMI</h1>
            <p class="limits-p">
              Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it
              is not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
              consider their BMI outcomes, and in some cases, consult a
              healthcare provider for further guidance.
            </p>
            <div class="gender frame">

              <h1>Gender</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, 
                a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="age frame">

              <h1>Age</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate 
                body fat content.

              </div>
              <p>
                Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a 
                healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother 
                and child.

              <h1>Muscle</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't 
                differentiate muscle from fat.

                Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at 
                lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your 
                GP or practice nurse.
